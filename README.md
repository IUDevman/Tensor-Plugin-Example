# Tensor-Plugin-Example
Example project for a Tensor plugin... You can probably make your own implementation of these project files, which would probably be better. I don't have anything set up like Maven so you're going to have to add the client dependancy locally like is done here.

Methods annotated with the @PluginEntryPoint annotation are the primary connection points to adding modules, commands, events, exc.

Really any version (or snapshot) of tensor should work pretty consistantly beyond 0.8.0-RELEASE.

Make sure to use the remapped jar appended with "-dev" or else some methods will return gibberish.
